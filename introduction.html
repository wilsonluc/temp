    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><b><u>By Douglas Richard Baker</u><br>
        (son of Douglas Raymond Baker) </b></p>
    <p> These are copies of letters written by my father Douglas Raymond Baker during the First World War (1914-1918) to
        his family in Gympie. I have three thick exercise books in which the letters were copied in hand writing by my
        Aunt Alice, his sister. I understand that this was done so his letters could be sent on to other members of the
        family. I don’t know if the originals are still in existence, probably not.<br><br>

        In the early letters Alice has not included the name of the person they were written to but later she writes at
        the beginning, “Letter to Dot”, “Letter to Mother”, etc. and later still copies the original, “Dear Al”, “Dear
        Mag”, etc.. Likewise the endings are often not laid out fully as we would do but Al may have done this or Dad
        may have been saving space on the page.<br><br>

        Some letters are slightly out of date order in the books but as most of these are around the time his father
        died I have put them in the correct order as this is crucial to understanding the sense of the contents. A lot
        will be missing – many, many ships were sunk but thanks to Aunt Alice we have these copies of the ones that did
        get through.<br><br>

        Where Dad used brackets in a letter I have used [ ] style and where I have made any comment or explanation I
        have used ( ) and Italics.<br><br>

        Where he uses the word “gay” it is used in the true sense, bright, happy, carefree, etc., This is the original
        meaning of the word before it became associated with the homosexual community.<br><br>

        The amounts of money are, of course, in Pounds, shillings and pence but as these are out of date and we have no
        pounds sign in the computer I have written them in, sometimes showing the decimal equivalents. One Pound
        equalled $2, one shilling equalled 10 cents and one penny equalled a little under one cent. After a while I
        stopped putting the equivalents in as they had no significance unless you knew the relative cost of things then
        and now. A shilling – equivalent to ten cents might actually buy ten or twenty dollars worth of goods now.</p><br>

    <p><b><u>
        Additional Comments by Ian Stuart Baker</u><br>
        (son of Douglas Richard Baker)</b><br><br>


        As the grandson of the Douglas Raymond, I'd like to share some thoughts with modern readers. Apart from the
        language issues that my Dad highlights, it would also help to recognise that in Grandfathers day, the letter was
        the only means of international communications for average people (telegrams were expensive and used rarely and
        international telephone calls, rarer still). That's why these letters are so important and why their content
        gives us window into their lives.<br><br>

        From discussions with my Dad, it has came to light that the content of letters to his direct family deliberately
        leave out much of the dreadful suffering and drudgery experienced by the diggers. This intentional self-editing
        was intended to allay the fears and concerns of those at home, inparticular, his mother and sisters.<br><br>

        Finally, let me express a debt of thanks to Great Aunt Alice for diligently transcribing the original letters
        for without this effort, we would not have the material we do today. Also, my gratitude to my father for his
        work transforming the hand-written script into a typed paper record and then into electronic format, making my
        part in this infinitely easier.
