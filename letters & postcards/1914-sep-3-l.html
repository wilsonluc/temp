    <h1>Letter. Thursday Sept. 3rd. 1914.</h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Marck Script', cursive; font-size: 20px">
        Before I start allow me to inform you all that I am writing under difficulties in a crowded tent and plenty of
        noise so excuse any mistakes. Wednesday was a big day for us [F Coy.]. We had the usual drill before breakfast
        and then after that meal, the whole company was vaccinated out in the open. The doctor put three dabs of Lymph
        on my arm and then scratched the skin over each till the blood came. When it dried up [1/2 hour] a piece of lint
        was put over and stuck on with sticking plaster. That’s the whole procedure and so far it has not affected me,
        but very probably will in a few days time.
        <br>
        <br> In the afternoon we were marched to the dentists and they were very rough on some of the fellows. There
        were
        three chairs occupied at a time and the mouth-maulers were kept busy. The chap who attended to mine said I had
        the best cared for teeth he had seen and called the other two dentists over to have a look at them. He filled
        one of my back teeth and I had the jaw-ache the rest of the day and all last night. It is still a bit sore but
        not too bad. One of our fellows had three drawn and five filled and others were just as bad. Last night I went
        to town and met Herb and put in the night with him till 10 p.m.. He is in good health and said he would be
        writing home soon. Today we all went to the range for musketry shooting and I think my shooting was
        satisfactory. I was on ammunition guard and went to the range in a cart while all the rest of the Coy. had to
        march – it is about a mile away. Over two thousand rounds of cartridges were used today. We were late getting
        home and I have only just had tea and a wash [after] and feel a bit tired.
        <br>
        <br> I was just asking Capt. Jackson if there was any chance of getting home for a day and he said, “No hope in
        the
        world”. It would be great, Dad, if you and Mum could get down just to have a look round. I often wish I was home
        for an hour or two to see you all. I have been wondering if that hamper is at Enoggera . I could not get in
        tonight and do not know if it would be brought to the camp.
        <br>
        <br> The cap Mum spoke of will be very acceptable and it is jolly good of Miss Goodall to make it. She is
        all-good. I will write to her when I get it. Do not take any notice of any rumour you hear about us leaving
        here. No one
        knows when it will be - although things seem to be getting pushed along as fast as possible here. Just got word
        a while ago that we were to be inoculated tomorrow, by jove it’s getting solid, we are like a lot of cattle,
        they will have us disabled before we leave here. If we kick against it it means the kick out., so we will have
        to grin and bear it. Between 50 and 60 more men will be coming to Camp tonight – most of them for our Company,
        so we will be up to full strength. Over 1050 letters have been posted from the Camp Y.M.C.A. since last Friday.
